# Hey, I'm Pawel

Indie developer building apps that help people focus, stay organized, and get things done. I ship native apps for iOS and macOS — clean, fast, privacy-first.

Currently exploring AI-powered tools, productivity systems, and whatever sparks curiosity.

## Apps on the App Store

```

More tools in the works.
