# Hey, I'm n0xer90

I build lightweight macOS utilities — small, fast, native apps that do one thing well. No Electron, no bloat, just Swift and Cocoa.

Everything ships as a single-file Swift app you can build yourself, download from [Releases](https://github.com/n0xer90?tab=repositories), or install via Homebrew.

## Install any of my apps

```bash
brew tap n0xer90/tap
brew install --cask <app-name>
```

## Apps

### Menu Bar Tools

🖥 **[MemoryBar](https://github.com/n0xer90/MemoryBar)** — Real-time memory & CPU monitor with sparkline graphs in your menu bar. Shows memory pressure, top processes, swap usage. ~90KB.

### Coming Soon

More lightweight macOS utilities in the works. Watch this space.
